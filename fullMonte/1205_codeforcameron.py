Making this code that defines a function to take data from 4 polarimetry scans,
calculate alpha and gamma (and error), then find the Jone matrix.

    This function will take a folder of polarimetry scans and produce
    alphas and gammas with error.

    :param observedSidebands: np array of observed sidebands. Data will be
        cropped such that these sidebands are included in everything.
    :param crystalAngle: (Float) Angle of the sample from the 010 crystal face
    :saveFileName: Str of what you want to call the text files to be saved
    :save_results: Boolean controls if things are saved to txt files.
        Currently saves DOP, alpha, gamma, J matrix, T matrix, Fan, and Matrix
